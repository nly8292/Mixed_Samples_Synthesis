This is the official implementation of the mixed sample synthesis model in the paper <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/determining-the-composition-of-a-mixed-material-with-synthetic-data/54D1870F67F0285C85F054FF78D45A96">Determining the Composition of a Mixed Material with Synthetic Data</a>

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN (CPU mode may work without any modification, but untested)
- Python 3.6
- Install necessary libraries with pip
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset
The dataset directory needs to be structured as follows:
```
${DATASET_ROOT_DIR}
|____DIR_PRECURSOR1
     |___image1
     |___image2
     |___image3
     ...
|____DIR_PRECURSOR2
     |___image1
     |___image2
     |___image3
     ...
|____DIR_PRECURSOR3
     |___image1
     |___image2
     |___image3
     ...
...                
```

## Synthesize Mixed Samples
Execute the script `run_script.sh` to generate mixed sample. Moreover, the following params inside `run_script.sh` can be modified to obtain desired behavior.
- `gpu_id` - GPU ID
- `num_scale` - The number of levels in the pyramid optimization
- `itr_vec` - The number of iterations at each scale
- `lr` - learning rate
- `start_num` - The starting index of the generated images
- `num_gen` - The number of synthetic images to be generated
- `precursors` - The precursors used for generating mixed samples
- `w_precursors` - The contribution of each precursor to the generated images
- `transf_type` - Data augmentation method `0:Normalize image input using ImageNet statistics | 1:Add sigmoid activation for generated on top of normalization of 0 | 2:No normalization`    
- `extracted_layers` - The layers from VGG16 to be used for computing statistics
- `w_stat` - Weight param for statistics loss
- `w_tv` - Weighted param for TV loss'    
- `gen_w` - Width of generated image
- `gen_h` - Height of generated image    
- `opt_type` - Type of optimizer `Adam (Default) | LBFGS`
- `stat_type` - Type of statistic to be computed for the extracted layers
- `root_dir` - Dataset root directory `${DATASET_ROOT_DIR}`    
- `out_dir` - Directory for storing generated images
- `tensorboard_dir` - Directory for storing tensorboard results
- `log_tensorboard` - Turn on tensorboard
- `display_ref_gen` - Displaying reference images and generated image on the same canvas
